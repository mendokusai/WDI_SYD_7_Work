20px padding is on either side. (added in css)

960 total (in example),

use float-to-side to make it stay attached to side, use it again, for the next piece to fill in space.

padding ~40px must be removed from two sides to make them fit 660 - 40; 300 - 40

box-sizing: border-box;
	this makes the padding issue not happen, but is only useful for modern browsers.

	browser prefixes:
	
	-moz-box-sizing: border-box;
	-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
	-o-box-sizing: border-box;
	-ms-box-sizing: border-box;
