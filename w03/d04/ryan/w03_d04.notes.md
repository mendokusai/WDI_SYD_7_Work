#Ruby Gems

zips up code, makes it available on a server. type require {gem}, now it works.

Check the internet for gems for projects you might want to make:
https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/faker


run bundle install (with a corresponding Gemfile with instructions on which gems to download..) 

JACK's apps

rails new link_manager
cd link_manager
rails g scaffold Link title:string url:string notes:text
rake db:migrate

rails new coffee_tracker
cd coffee_tracker
rails g scaffold CoffeeOrder milk:string type:string extras:string name:string
rake db:migrate
rails server

#Rails

rails new {application}

file structure

most things will go into the app folder

		-app
			-helpers - profile_image
				quickly create things.
			-mailer - email related
			-models - a lot of work here, business logic when user does THIS, do THAT, validations, encryption
			-views -page for controller
				-layouts - html setup

		-config
			?.yml file?
			routes.rb 

			environmnents (3 by default) doesn't minify css, js
				test -test files
				production

			initializer - do something when it starts server

			secrets - generates security keys for encryption

		-db
			-migration files
			-seed data 

		-lib - not touched often

		-vendor - put third-party software (like jquery files) so they don't get mixed in too well.

		-config.ru important
		-gemfile
		-gemfile.log - listing of gens
		-rakefile
		-readme


#app
# beginning a project, steps:

-make a README and establish the purpose, maybe scenarios of how it should work.

push to git -
	git add, commit -'initial commit'
# for reset
#	# git add .
#	# git reset --hard {resets to last git}
rails g controller Animals index

{PLURAL is important for the whole project}
config>routes

commit

resources :animals, only [:index]
{only index tells rails NOT to generate multiple pages...}

commit
# (don't commit broken code)
# check with rails s(erver)

rails g model Animal name:string species:string breed:string arrival_time:datetime departure_time:datetime gender:string age:integer

creates migration -> the fields in the database

commit

rake db:migrate

rails console

rails g migration AddSexToAnimals sex:string active_record

reove_column :animals, :gender [to db]

rake db:migrate

sparky = Animals.new
sparky.attribute = "variable"
sparky.save - saves the entry.


#classes

in an initialization...
self.variable = variable is a little better than @variable

@ sets a variable

self.{variable} calls a method on the variable

#class method

you can definie a method on the class itself.

a class is an instance of the class object.

Animal = Class.new

Animal.all

Class inheritance

superclass, subclass

#seven standard actions
index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy

for a form
