Jumping into Rails. Early.

rails is a web framework


MVC - model (deals with database)
 views (change data into HTML ie. erb)
 controllers (handles things (urls, parameters))

 models and views shoudln't talk to each other

 CRUD - create read update delete

 REST - representatonal state transfer

 DRY - don't repeat yourself

 COC convention over configuration

Active Record DB handler

model is a class that deals with the database
view is how the details is rendered

Model <> Controller <> View

Browser > Webserver >App Server > Rails > Routes.rb > Controller > Model > Controller > Views > App Server > Webserver>Browser

Controller to the model is the same Controller from the model.
